# IDC621

The course contained 4 different modules to explore various kinds of complex system. Here I describe my work for each module.

1. **Cellular Automata Models**: I worked on the classic [Abelian Sandpile Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model), its extension to infinite square grid and computing the identity element. I also looked at various methods to computationally optimise the grid stabilizations process.
2. **Oscillator Chains**: I analyzed the coupled oscillator model as described by [Kuramoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto_model) and its extension to a 2D coupled lattice.
3. **Coupled Map Lattice**: I looked at various 1D nonlinear maps and types of coupling and the generation of different types of spatiotemporal chaos exhibited by combining these into [CMLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_map_lattice). Also, an unsuccessful attempt at simulating boiling liquid by the use of this CML framework :(
4. **Complex Networks**: I demonstrated various [complex networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network) and how to use them along with a Kuramoto-like dynamical system to model how people change their own opinions!
